1.4.11.3:
* Added: Config option for blacklisting entities for Challenger Mobs.

* Added: Imperishable enchantment! Keeps tools and armor from being broken when down to 1 durability
* Added: Imperishable spawns (**only**) in Nether Fortress Chests. This is the only way of obtaining them.

* Changed: Internal Code - a lot. Many, MANY code improvements

* Fixed: HangingItemFix acting wonky with Jukeboxes, Item Frames and Paintings
